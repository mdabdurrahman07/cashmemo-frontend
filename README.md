## Overview

The main feature of our app is to connect suppliers and wholesalers on a single platform. This app will help both suppliers and wholesalers by making it easier to generate invoices for any sales, maintain stock of their products, simplify taxation, and keep business records. In the Bangladeshi market, there are two major players in the supply chain: suppliers and wholesalers. Suppliers buy products directly from farmers and sell them to wholesalers, taking a commission or profit. Wholesalers then collect the products from suppliers and sell them to retailers. However, instead of selling directly to retailers, products often go through middlemen, leading to price increases due to lack of tracking.

CashMemo addresses this issue by registering wholesalers and ensuring that every sale is accompanied by an invoice. Gradually, we plan to bring everyone onto our platform, from farmers to retailers. Additionally, we are implementing features where wholesalers and suppliers can manage their stock efficiently and monitor their profit and losses, enabling them to make better business decisions.

An integrated AI system, trained with local business laws and fine-tuned for our specific use case, will assist business owners in quickly accessing necessary information. This AI will enhance decision-making and operational efficiency.

To effectively address the issue of price hikes, we plan to collaborate with the government for implementation. This partnership will ensure that every transaction is tracked and rules are enforced to prevent illegal trade without a proper cash memo. The system will provide a comprehensive record of all purchase information for an organization, enabling better oversight and transparency.

In summary, CashMemo leverages technology to simplify trading for wholesalers and suppliers while equipping the government with essential tools to monitor and regulate the supply chain effectively. By combining advanced functionality with strategic collaboration, CashMemo aims to significantly impact Bangladesh's economic stability.

## Vision

We don't want to change everything in the next two years; instead, we want to change the future in the next twenty years. Our long-term vision is to create a sustainable and transparent supply chain that benefits all stakeholders, from farmers to retailers, ensuring economic stability and growth for Bangladesh.
